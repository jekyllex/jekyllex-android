[github]: https://github.com/jekyllex/jekyllex-android/releases/latest

JekyllEx is an Android App that allows you to manage a [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll?tab=readme-ov-file#jekyll) powered Blog directly from your Android device!

The app has undergone major reworks since [it's inception](https://genicsblog.com/introducing-jekyllex-android-app) as a GitHub API based implementation and is now a standalone app that embeds `git`, `ruby`, `jekyll` and other dependencies natively to provide a seamless experience in a powerful and easy to use interface.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The [old implementation](https://github.com/jekyllex/jekyllex-android/tree/api-impl) has been archived and the releases have been deprecated!
